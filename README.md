# Plant App

Practice design layout. Inspired in the [video from Youtube](https://youtu.be/LN668OAUrK4) and the [GIT](https://github.com/abuanwar072/Plant-App-Flutter-UI).

**Packages we are using:**

- flutter_svg: [link](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg)

Practice creating a custom plant sales app on Flutter.

The home page (HomeScreen) has search, navigation, and recommendation lists.
Clicking on the card of one of the plants opens a page with detailed information (DetailsPlantsScreen) about the plant. It contains detail buttons (empty), a picture, and purchase buttons.

This project took 12 and a half hours to complete.
